About You

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work

Embedded Linux Software Engineer | Canonical | Brisbane, Queensland, Australia | Remote | About the job
This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.

We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.

Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.

These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.

But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.

We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.

These roles include:

Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)

At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.

Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.

What your day will look like

Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:

Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies
Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms
Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks
Write high-quality, well-designed software
Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams 
Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities 
Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu
Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server
Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities 
Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them 
Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind 
Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions 
Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge 
Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events 

What we are looking for in you

An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
Passion for embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto, RTOS) 
Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust 
Professional written and spoken English 
Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) 
Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability 
Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation 
Excellent communication and presentation skills 
Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments 
Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each

Additional Skills That You Might Also Bring

Experience with Debian/Ubuntu or other distro packaging 
Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation 
Experience with firmware, uboot, UEFI, ACPI, DSDT, or boot loaders
Experience with power management on PCI ASPM, SATA ALPM, low power profiles 
Computer architecture knowledge of x86, ARM, RISC-V 
Experience in board design, bring up, and validation 
Experience with electrical engineering design tools (e.g. schematic capture, layout) 
Familiarity with Ubuntu development model
Performance engineering and security experience

Superb troubleshooting. You can take big problems and break them down into manageable pieces with elegant solutions. 
Deep knowledge of WordPress and some understanding of the underlying code. Whether you are currently supporting individuals with their sites or maintaining your own, we’re looking for theme, plugin, block editor, or e-commerce experience. For many of our customer tickets, it’s important to be able to read the code when diagnosing and resolving problems and have experience with WP-CLI, hooks and filters, imports, etc.

Support engineers connect the dots for our customers. Your day-to-day work may include much of the following: Providing customers with the best possible first impression of WordPress VIP.

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work

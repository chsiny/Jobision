About You

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work

Embedded Linux Software Engineer | Canonical | Brisbane, Queensland, Australia | Remote | About the job
This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.

We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.

Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.

These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.

But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.

We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.

These roles include:

Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)

At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.

Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.

What your day will look like

Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:

Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies
Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms
Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks
Write high-quality, well-designed software
Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams 
Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities 
Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu
Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server
Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities 
Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them 
Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind 
Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions 
Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge 
Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events 

What we are looking for in you

An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
Passion for embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto, RTOS) 
Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust 
Professional written and spoken English 
Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) 
Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability 
Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation 
Excellent communication and presentation skills 
Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments

Deep knowledge of WordPress and some understanding of the underlying code.

Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work

Software Engieer (Python & Javascript) | affix | Cremorne, Victoria, Australia | On-site | About the job
Meet: Fillr

Founded: 2015
Headcount: 20
Location: Cremorne
Tech stack for this role: OO Programming with Python, AWS, Docker
Tech stack across Fillr: NodeJS, CoffeeScript, Python, Snowflake, Tableau, AWS and Google Cloud.
Product: SaaS, autofill as a service
Parent company: Rakuten
Role Type: 12 MFTC

The Story

Fillr is the world’s most accurate autofill technology, an ultra intelligent data exchange platform with a 95% + accuracy that is proven to be more accurate than Google/Apple’s autofill offerings. Pretty impressive for a small local Melbourne team, huh?

It’s an exciting time to be joining Fillr as they are embarking on a new journey after merging with Rakuten Americas whose business portfolio includes market leaders in e-commerce, digital marketing, advertising, business intelligence, logistics, communications, and entertainment.

This role is a 12 month fixed term contract.

The Product 

They’ve rolled their auto-fill-as-a-service into a suite of mobile apps that are used by thousands of users daily in every country of the world. Fillr provides online shoppers with a fast means to transact anywhere instantly by removing the tedium of typing personal details every time a website requires ecommerce details such as name, address and credit cards.

Then there’s Rakuten’s Rewards cash back product. To date, their 17 million members in the U.S. alone have earned over $3.7 billion in cash back at their favourite stores. It’s a fascinatingly complex system, with millions of users and that is at the very heart of their business.

Rakuten Rewards directly puts money back into the pockets of users, which is pretty damn cool to think about. A product like this is all about driving greater accuracy within the product pipeline, ensuring users receive the rewards they deserve.

The Techy Bits 

The Rakuten Rewards tech stack is across JavaScript and Python, running on AWS.

Initially you will work across the Rakuten Rewards platform, understanding the tech stack & all of the edge cases within there. Once you’ve found your feet there, you’ll also jump into the data engineer and autofill team to work on Fillr’s core products -- iOS and Android SDKs that use their in house API to serve Autofill to their clients.

Fillr’s tech stack is built within AWS and mainly comprises VPC based architecture deployed by Buildkite and Github Actions CI/CD using cloudformation templates. The API is mainly written in NodeJS and is deployed in a multi region fashion to ensure scalability and redundancy across their multi-tiered client and user base. The in-form analytics are built using CoffeeScript and deployed by Buildkite via AWS CloudFront.

A little bit about you

Most importantly, you are a curious mind who loves to try their hand at things, even if you don’t yet know everything you need to or the ‘how’. Fillr is a supportive environment where learning through failure is a badge of honor!
Strong investigative and communication skills across international teams.
You are devoted to writing elegant (think: clean & easy to understand by other people) and functional code.
You have some commercial JavaScript experience.
You have some commercial experience with Object-Oriented Programming in Python
You *love* problem solving.
Familiarity with automation tools like GitHub Actions.
Proficiency in Datadog, SQL, and Snowflake for data analysis and dashboard creation.
Experience using Docker for containerization and deployment of applications.
Familiarity with Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Bonus points if you have: 

Some experience with LLM experimentation (e.g., LLAMA3, Mistral).

What’s in it for you?

📍 Hybrid, with a mix of remote & 3 days a week in person collaboration at their Cremorne based office. You’ll find engineers, designers, sales and company directors all working tightly together and having a bit of fun while they’re at it. Expect regular team lunches and outings, and lots of cake (yum)!

❤️ Families (and life) come first. Flexible working is at the very heart of Fillr’s ways of working, and you’ll find folks who work a variety of ways (part time, flex start & finish times + more) that suit their unique needs.

🧠 Lots of opportunities for career growth -- with a training/conference budget, the space + support to actually do your L&D within business hours, and supportive mentors who want to you see you shine. Think: Yow, DevOps Days, Udemy courses + more!

🎨 They have an open culture of sharing knowledge, ideas and laughs from all parts of the business. Everyone is encouraged to share their creativity on all aspects of the business, including product, and they ensure all ideas are treated equally.

🤙 Most importantly, the folks at Fillr are curious minds who love to try their hand at things. There’s is a supportive environment where learning through failure is a badge of honour!


Next steps

Please apply online or reach out if you have any questions. We'd love to hear from you!
